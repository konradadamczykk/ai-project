# How to run

```

```

Leave PC, get back after 5-10 minutes, then get directory from https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iqVAzHjE18FH-ciTADyEdRXT34cwWEoO and place it at the project root (Github does not allow us to have files larger than 100MB)

```
python tf_backend.py
```

You may probably need to bypass whole training and data download sections.
Wait for some time (based on your setup, it could be either hour or day)
